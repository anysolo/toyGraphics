Window
****************************

Your program has precisely one window. The window has no title or any other decorations.
To close the window, you can either stop the program or use keyboard shortcuts, for instance, Alt+F4 in Windows.

To create the window, you must create an object of Window class. You also should pass
the width and height of the window as arguments. Example:

.. code-block:: kotlin

    val wnd = Window(1027, 768)
